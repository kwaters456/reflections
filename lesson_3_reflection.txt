When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When swapping between different computers or collaborating on a project with different people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Automatic will pull changes that may reset code you are working on or break it. Manual pulls lets you get the information you need, when you need it.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks clone from one GitHub account to another. Clones copy one repository creating another locally or on GitHub. Branches show different work paths in the same repository. 
    Fork when you want to edit a GitHub repository you dont have permission to edit. Clone when you want to work on it locally. Branch when you are working on a different feature or are fixing a bug.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    You have the most recent updates from all the collaborators.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Email, jump drives. Email has file size limitations and you have to deal with monstrously long email chains. Jump drives you have to be in person to exchange, so no live updates.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    Create a separate branch when working on a bug fix or an added feature, some new facet of the program. Creating another branch allows you to work on a bug or feature without breaking the master program. All changes in the master branch gives you a linear workflow to follow.
