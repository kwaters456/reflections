When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When swapping between different computers or collaborating on a project with different people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Automatic will pull changes that may reset code you are working on or break it. Manual pulls lets you get the information you need, when you need it.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks clone from one GitHub account to another. Clones copy one repository creating another locally or on GitHub. Branches show different work paths in the same repository. 
    Fork when you want to edit a GitHub repository you dont have permission to edit. Clone when you want to work on it locally. Branch when you are working on a different feature or are fixing a bug.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    You have the most recent updates from all the collaborators.
