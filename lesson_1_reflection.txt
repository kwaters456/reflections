How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It showed the code that was different between the 2 files.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    More able to make changes without fear of crippling the program.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Manual commits allow me to only commit when a substantial change has been made.
    Automatic commits can leave broken code and inoperable programs.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Different architectures are needed for each system. Text files generally are in 
    one file. While programs are over many files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log gives the names of all the commits, then you can use git diff to compare and contrast all the different commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can always go back to a previous version. No fear of breaking the program.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    The mobile app development courses.
